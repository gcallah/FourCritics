            Introduction*
        </h1>

        <p>
            "Rationalism" is an overloaded term. In mainstream
            analytical history of philosophy, it is often used as a contrast
            class to "empiricism." "Rationalists" believe
            that "pure reason" gives us the best guide
            to truth, while "empiricists" favor experience. 
            In this usage, Plato, Descartes, Spinoza,
            and Leibniz are "rationalists," while Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and
            Hume are characterized as "empiricists." While we do not object to
            this use of "rationalism," it tandentially related to what we wish
            to address in this volume. In fact, both share a central tendency
            extensively criticized by the thinkers we cover. As Mark Mitchell
            put it in his contribution to this work, "The twin streams of early
            modern philosophy, rationalism and empiricism, both rejected
            dependence on tradition and authority."
        </p>

        <p>
            Instead, the notion of "rationalism" we are dealing with is about
            the relationship of the abstract and the
            concrete. The "rationalists" being criticized by the thinkers we
            examine believe that thought is abstract thought, and
            that theory should be able to direct practice.
            The common thread connecting our critics of rationalism
            is that each of them, in one way or another, criticized "abstract
            thought" not in and of itself, but insofar as it tried to replace
            "concrete thought," or tradition, or evolved moral rules,
            as a guide to how people actually should behave,
            or how they actually should evaluate certain proposals.
            (One thing that differentiates these thinkers is to what exactly they
            contrast rationalism.)
        </p>

        <p>
            So, as a preliminary effort at clarifying what "rationalism" means,
            let us describe how we understand the "rationalism" that each of
            our thinkers criticizes, if not explicitly, then at least
            implicitly.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hans-Georg Gadamer’s development of philosophical hermeneutics was
            a critical achievement against the rationalism that at times sought
            to dominate the social sciences and humanities in the last century.
            Gadamer defended the possibility of truth in these fields of human
            endeavor and knowledge, while denying that there was a definitive
            methodology for apprehending and articulating it.  While he was
            sometimes accused of relativism (for instance, by Leo Strauss), he
            resolutely denied the charge, insisting that there was an
            alternative to scientistic rationalism and relativism.  In his
            greatest work, <i>Truth and Method</i>, Gadamer argued that it is a
            mistake to try to establish scientific knowledge as the archetype
            of all knowledge, as this ignores the possibility for truth being
            known through the contingency and finitude of human existence,
            rather than in spite of it. 
        </p>

        <p>
            F.A. Hayek developed his critique of rationalism in the context
            of defeasing the socialist planner's pretense that he could
            "rationally" direct the entirety of a society's economic
            activity according to a plan worked out from purely
            theoretical knowledge of that society: no knowledge of "the
            circumstances of time and place" was necessary, according
            to the socialist planner. Unlike, for instance,
            Michael Oakeshott, Hayek tended to
            see the complement of rationalism as <i>non</i>rational,
            rather than as a different form of reason from abstract
            thought.
        </p>

        <p>
            Aurel Kolnai strived to steer clear of both a Settembrinian creed of
            Reason and a Naphta-style cult of Irrationalism. His lifelong
            commitment was to phenomenological objectivism. He asserted that
            there is an objective moral order consisting of positive values
            that we are called to experience and make sense of in our moral
            life; and that there are prohibitions which make us alert to moral
            evil. He also stressed the importance of ordinary experience and
            common sense as antidotes to rationalism.
            His criticism of rationalism, especially robust in his
            writings on the utopian mind, aims at showing that a fully rational
            human world where everything is automatically rendered good,
            exterminates our moral capability of choosing between good and
            evil.
        </p>

        <p>
            Alasdair MacIntyre's chief rationalist target is Enlightenment, or
            "encyclopedic," morality, which claims that it can work out
            moral behavior from abstract principles, without 
            an "irrational" reliance on moral customs and habits.
            He argues that, in fact, Enlightenment rationalism, rather than 
            being the "tradition-free" pure reasoning that it purports to be,
            is itself a tradition, one that values continual argumentation
            over historically established ethical principles as
            representing the highest moral virtue.
        </p>

        <p>
            For Michael Oakeshott, rationalism is first and foremost the
            attempt to dispense with practical know-how by substituting
            for it an abstraction drawn <i>from</i> practice. 
            Such an attempt has no possibility of success, but it can
            nevertheless have pernicious consequences for those who try
            to pursue this "ideal." He sees rationalism as having an
            especially strong hold on politics, as the practitioners
            may not directly suffer the consequences of their faulty
            decision making themselves -- they have no "skin in the game,"
            as Nassim Nicholas Taleb would put it -- but can impose those effects on
            others.
        </p>

        <p>
            Michael Polanyi did not employ the term "rationalism," instead
            calling the trend he opposed "objectivism," by which he meant the
            belief that the only true human knowledge was what was
            scientifically or logically demonstrable. That view is false,
            he argued, because all such "provable" knowledge rests on
            things we know but cannot prove. His argument here is similar
            to Wittgenstein's that the ability to follow explicit rules rests
            upon a "way of life" that cannot be stated as a rule without
            invoking an infinite regress. It also bears a resemblance
            to Oakeshott's contention that the rationalist cannot
            really act according to rationalist dictums, but will
            instead unwittingly fall back upon some tradition of behavior.
            Polanyi drew a distinction between knowledge that can be
            explicitly stated, and "tacit knowledge," or knowing how to
            do something, perhaps without being able to state in rules
            or abstract principles exactly what one knows, in this regard 
            making an argument closely akin to Ryle's distinction between
            "knowing that" and "knowing how."
        </p>

        <p>
            Gilbert Ryle's critique of rationalism focuses
            on the claim made by many modern
            epistemologists that all knowledge can
            be reduced to 'knowing that...'
            statements, while Ryle instead insists
            that there are multiple forms of
            knowledge that cannot be reduced to
            mere statements of fact.  Indeed, questions
            about 'knowing how' to do something
            (e.g. hit a baseball, ride a bicycle, speak
            Spanish, play the mandolin, formulate
            a scientific hypothesis, etc.) are not
            reducible to statements of fact, at all.
            He associates the reductionist
            argument with a misguided notion about
            the relevance of the methods of the
            natural sciences to other forms of knowing.
        </p>

        <p>
            Eric Voegelin does not use the term "rationalism" in the
            way that Oakeshott and Hayek do, and instead attacks
            "ideology" and "scientism." While there is some
            difference in meaning here, there is also common
            ground: to Oakeshott, "rationalism in
            politics" presents itself as ideologies.
            In fact, a good definition of an ideology would be
            "an attempt to conduct politics according to a theory, 
            rather than guided by practical reason." And Voegelin
            understands ideologies to be destructive, for one reason,
            because they denigrate "common sense" and pragmatism, so
            that we would sensibly see Oakeshott and Voegelin both as
            advocates of "practical politics" as opposed to ideological
            politics. Furthermore, both Hayek and Oakeshott took
            scientism to be a form of rationalism, and a prevalent one at that.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ludwig Wittgenstein's main rationalist target was the attempt to
            turn thought, and in particular philosophical thought,
            into pure formalism. He noted that, for instance, our
            ability to follow a rule cannot have a merely formal
            foundation, but rests in a way of life that gives meaning
            to the formal specification.
        </p>

        <p>
            Having briefly reviewed what rationalism meant to the thinkers
            we discuss in this volume, let us take a brief look at each essay
            it contains.
        </p>

        <p>
            Zoltan Balazs compares the moral thinking of the Hungarian 
            philosopher and political theorist with that of Michael
            Oakeshott. Despite broad areas of agreement between the two --
            both are, in some sense, conservative, and both are critical
            of the modern rationalist rejection of habit and custom --
            Balazs finds that Kolnai provides something Oakeshott lacks:
            a robust, non-relativistic conception of the good, and a
            positive view of the role that a (non-rationalist) moral
            philosophy might provide in shoring up that conception.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nathanael Blake contends that the work of Gadamer and MacIntyre shows us
            how to avoid the complementary dangers of rigid moral certitude
            and spineless moral relativism. Both Gadamer and MacIntyre (who
            has drawn heavily on Gadamer in his own writing) argue that
            accepting the historically contingent nature of all of our
            moral reasoning does <i>not</i> imply that any old moral
            position is just as good as any other one. As Blake has it,
            "Presenting Enlightenment rationalism as the alternative to
            relativism is a false dichotomy... Rationality does not entail
            leaping outside of our historical existence, but develops within
            it."
        </p>

        <p>
            Both authors examined by Blake hold that tradition, far from
            being an obstacle to reason, is, in fact, its necessary
            ground: we can reason at all only by having become educated in a
            tradition that instructs us in how to do so. As Gadamer notes,
            pure inertia is never enough to sustain a tradition; instead,
            it must be "affirmed, embraced, cultivated," and the
            continuation of a tradition is every it as much a choice as 
            is revolution against it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, in moral reasoning the concrete is always more
            important than the abstract, or, as Blake writes, "Moral 
            clarity arises from the realization that this is
            the right thing to do, here and now, in this
            particular circumstance."
        </p>

        <p>
            In the end, Blake finds MacIntyre's viewpoint more
            comprehensive than Gadamer's, in that the latter
            is dismissive of natural law theories of morality,
            while the former finds a place for them 
            as the ground rules for any engagement in moral reasoning with
            others.
        </p>

        <p>
            Gene Callahan's central thesis is that, while
            Oakeshott's and Hayek's understanding of rationalism
            bear similarities, there are also important differences,
            differences that are, in the end, even more important than
            the similiarities. Furthermore, the differences are
            comprehensible when understood as arising from the two 
            thinkers different philosophical outlooks: Hayek's
            emergent materialism and Oakeshott's idealism.
            Given his outlook, Hayek must understand rationalism
            as the attempt to handle, with reason, areas of human life
            that are inherently "nonrational." Oakeshott, on the
            other hand, conceives as rationalism as the attempt
            to apply <i>abstract</i> reason, and in particular scientific
            abstractions, to problems that can only be handled
            through practical reasoning.
        </p>

        <p>
            Colin Cordner's essay analyzes the differences between Voegelin's
            and Polanyi's views on "scientism," which should be understood as a
            major species of rationalism: the abstractions of 
            science, so this view goes, are the
            only valid way to understand the human experience, and all of its
            rivals must either "become scientific" or fade away.
            He contrasts scientism to true science, writing that the
            "comparison shall be of an ideal of a closed, fully objective and
            self-contained system of explicit rules and propositions,
            to the open, striving to understand the real by a responsible and
            embodied person. It is the latter, living and incarnate... which
            both thinkers uphold as the paradigm of both science and of
            spiritual health."
        </p>

        <p>
            In fact, per Cordner, scientism is part of the modern "revolt
            against reality," in that it denies the "luminosity of
            consciousness," the reality that the person attempting to adopt the
            scientistic view ignores the fact that he is himself a crucial
            aspect of reality: reality coming into self-awareness. The
            "dogmatic construction of reality as merely thing-reality... [is a]
            derailment, [within which] all experience of transcendence may come
            to be seen as instances of... insanity." As Polanyi pointed out,
            the scientistic stance attempts to subject everything to doubt, a
            stance which, if actually adopted, would make science impossible:
            science proceeds first by "commitment... and personal knowledge,"
            with doubt being simply an auxiliiary tool to the scientist's
            "commitment to truth." Cordner concludes that Polanyi and Voegelin
            are "fully in agreement" on the nature of scientism, with their
            apparent differences coming down to a matter of terminological
            choices.
        </p>

        <p>
            David Corey's essay, "Voegelin on Ideology"
        </p>

        <p>
            Timothy Fuller's contribution compares how Leo Strauss,
            Michael Oakeshott, and Eric Voegelin differed in their 
            understanding of English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, but, more
            importantly, shows how those different understandings help us 
            to comprehend the different viewpoints of Strauss, Oakeshott,
            and Voegelin.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Strauss saw a fundamental continuity between Hobbes
            and the classical tradition of political philosophy in the
            following regard: "He pursued a philosophic understanding of
            politics which cannot be reduced merely to debate over policy
            preferences."
        </p>

        <p>
            Voegelin appreciated Hobbes's effort to dampen the
            fanaticism that the religious schisms of his time had produced.
            But he argued that Hobbes's attempt ultimately came up short,
            as questions of "ultimate meaning" cannot, in fact,
            be continually banished from politics, but will
            repeatedly arise in new political movements resisting
            the banishment of the sacred from political life.
        </p>

        <p>
            Oakeshott, meanwhile, understood Hobbes as the first great thinker
            to seriously grapple with the modern condition of 
            a polity composed of individuals with fundamentally
            divergent worldviews.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whatever their differences regarding Hobbes,
            Fuller concludes that, "Oakeshott, Strauss
            and Voegelin, in setting out to do this each
            in his own way, attest to Hobbes’s
            significance by engaging him at the level of philosophic
            dialogue he invites."
        </p>

        <p>
            Grant Havers's paper, "Wittgenstein and the Athens-Jerusalem Conflict"
            addresses the problem of the "two Wittgensteins":
            the young positivist who wrote the <i>Tractatus</i>, and the
            latter thinker who was skeptical about the power of abstract
            thought, and at times even seemed skeptical of the whole
            philosophical venture. Havers sets his examination of
            Wittgenstein in the context of the conflict between
            Athens and Jerusalem highlighted by Leo Strauss. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In particular, Havers asked whether, by his later-life embrace
            of the "Jerusalem" side of the conflict with "Athens,"
            Wittgenstein had not, in fact, abandoned philosophy completely
            in favor of faith. Havers seeks his answer chiefly in
            Wittgenstein's work <i>Culture and Value</i>, believing it
            "represents Wittgenstein's deepest reflections on the conflict
            between Athens and Jerusalem." In particular, Havers sees  that
            work as containing Wittgenstein's "subtle defense of the
            ontological argument" for the existence of God. Havers believes
            that this argument, as understood by Wittgenstein, "helps us
            truly understand what is at stake in the conflict between 
            Athens and Jerusalem."
        </p>

        <p>
            Havers provocatively suggests that Wittgenstein, in the
            end, finds the ontological argument to be one that shortcuts
            the dualism of religion <i>versus</i> philosophy, as it
            employs philosophical reasoning to demonstrate that God
            is not an empirical object that science could discover
            "out there" in the world, and that faith in God, once
            properly understood as an <i>attitude towards life</i>,
            is at least as "rational" as scientific materialism.
            And he goes on to suggest that true philosophy and genuine
            religious faith are actually allies, both opposed to "the
            idols of God and Man."

        <p>Ferenc H&ouml;rcher,
            "Comparing Oakeshott's and MacIntyre's Concepts of Practical
            Knowledge"
        </p>

        <p>
            Kenneth McIntyre's paper examines the similar critiques
            of rationalism offered by Oakeshott and his English
            contemporary, Gilbert Ryle. Ryle's masterwork, <i>The
            Concept of Mind</i>, received a favorable review from 
            Oakeshott, although he did criticize it for offering a 
            somwhat shallow characterization of idealism. Neverthless,
            the reviewer clearly felt that Ryle's critique of
            contemporary doctrines of mind as a "ghost in the machine"
            were largely in agreement with his own work on rational
            conduct. Neither thinker thought that action could 
            possibly come about as it should per the rationalist 
            account: no one could "rationally," with an empty slate
            mind, simply think about some activity, prior to having
            engaged in it, and then go about it with mastery. Oakeshott's
            summary of Ryle (from his review) shows how close their 
            ideas were:
        </p>

        <p>
            "In general [Ryle's] doctrine is that 'when we describe people
            is exercising qualities of mind, we are not referring to occult
            episodes of which their overt acts and utterances are effects:
            we are referring to those overt acts and utterances
            themselves.' Mental activity is not the activity of a 'mind,'
            or activity which takes place in the hidden recesses of a mind,
            in distinction from the activity of a body: it is doing and
            saying things in a particular manner."
                </p>

                <p>
            Neverthless, the two thinkers differed in some important ways.
            As McIntyre notes, Oakeshott had a much more robust conception
            of the "modes" in which thought might appear than did Ryle, who
            simply noted that we quite properly think about different areas
            of life employing different ways of proceeding. And the
            philosophical basis for Oakeshott's critique of rationalism is
            more explicit: it stems from his British Idealist roots. Ryle,
            a serious student of phenomenological philosophy, mentioned
            that his attack on the ghost in the machine might be understood
            as a work of phenomenology, but did not stress this connection,
            something that might be viewed as either a weakness or a
            strength in his approach, depending on one's view of the
            importance of philosophical grounding for an epistemology.
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite these differences, Oakeshott and Ryle can be seen as 
            twin sons of different mothers, both working to undermine the
            same, prevalent misconception of the nature of the mental. As
            McIntyre sums it up:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            The philosophical significance of Ryle's
            and Oakeshott's conclusions is
            quite far-reaching. The acceptance of the priority of tacit knowledge
            involves the rejection of philosophical
            accounts of morality, politics, and
            the law which reduce them to a set of
            rule-like statements and a similar
            rejection of the reductionist accounts of epistemology.

            Mark Mitchell compares the attitude of Eric Voegelin and
            Michael Polanyi to the problem of faith. The notion of faith
            relates to rationalism as follows: the rationalist typically
            contends that we must never, on pain of being condemned as
            "irrational," rely on any notions that cannot be demonstrated,
            empirically or logically, as being true, or at least probable.
            But, as Mitchell shows, both Polanyi and Voegelin demonstrate
            that this idea is incoherent: "all we know and <i>cannot</i>
            prove... underlies, and must ultimately set its seal to,
            all that we <i>can</i> prove."
        </p>

        <p>
            Mitchell argues that Polanyi's and Voegelin's critiques of
            rationalism dovetail nicely; as he puts it:
            "the epistemological solution encompassed in Polanyi's
            personal knowledge fits well with Voegelin’s insistence that we
            must recover an awareness of human participation in
            transcendent reality...
            the solutions offered by both provide useful
            supports for the other: Polanyi's theory of knowledge adds an
            important dimension to Voegelin, while Voegelin's insistence on
            openness to the transcendent makes explicit what Polanyi only
            occasionally intimates."
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, both thinkers offer similar critiques of the societal
            effects of the current dominance of rationalism. The link between
            rationalism and totalitarianism arises from the fact that
            "scientistic men are at liberty to attempt to re-create human
            nature in a more suitable fashion than that which had been
            previously tolerated." And since scientism, or objectivism, rejects
            all traditional moral restraints as atavisms to be overcome, there
            were no limits on the tactics these men could employ to create this
            "new man": the Gulag, the killing fields, and concentration camps
            were all just ways to rid humanity of the "reactionary" elements
            who resisted the various rationalist visions. Importantly, as
            Mitchell notes, this movement in truth had nothing "scientific"
            about it: "Scientism became the new religion, and its priests, the
            scientists and modern philosophers, employed epistemological
            objectivism as their instrument of worship."

            John von Heyking asks the question, "Was Hayek a Rationalist?"

            <br />
            He describes "rationalism in politics" as follows:
            "Because he seeks perfect justice, the rationalist seeks to
            rearrange political society with the precision of a mathematician
            while practical wisdom acknowledges the messiness, tensions, and
            ambiguities of political life. Practical wisdom affirms nature’s
            smudging of lines while the rationalist does not tolerate it."
        </p>

        <p>
            Daniel Sportiello's essay, "Rationalism in Voegelin,"
            examines what, exactly, "rationalism" meant to Voegelin.
            He invokes the idea of an "Axial Age," first formulated by Karl
            Jaspers, as a way of differentiating what, for Voegelin, was truly
            reasonable, as opposed to what modern rationalists consider to be
            reasonable. As Sportiello describes the situation, prior to the
            Axial Age (roughly to be placed between 800 and 500 BCE), the human
            good "was a matter of attaining the
            material: at the risk of caricature, happiness meant more food,
            drink, wives, sons, and daughters -- and, once they became relevant,
            more money and possessions." To the contrary, the great figures of
            the Axial Age, such as Buddha, Lao-Tse, Plato, Confucius,
            Zoroaster, and Isaiah, held that human flourishing depended upon
            adherence to a transcendental order that might entail sacrificing
            material well-being to conform to that order. Rather than treating
            all other humans as competitors, whose achievement of the good
            would tend to block one's own such achievement, to truly achieve
            happiness required respecting the "golden rule" of treating others
            as one would oneself wish to be treated. In that for Voegelin, as
            for Jaspers, the Axial Age was an advance in human consciousness,
            "what is authentically rational is what is axial."
        </p>

        <p>
            Thus, for Voegelin, "'rationalism,' as the word is usually used
            today, indicates what is, according to Voegelin, irrational." (And
            in this respect, Voegelin is completely aligned with Oakeshott,
            who, in a letter to Karl Popper, noted that "rationalism in my
            sense is...  thoroughly unreasonable."
            https://www.scribd.com/document/78647839/Letter-to-Popper)
        </p>

        <p>
            Quite to the contrary, for rationalist theorists, "rooting society
            in the axial conception of happiness was a sort of madness." And
            the 17th and 18th century rationalists would cite the English Civil
            War and the Thirty Years' War as evidence for that contention. But,
            as Sportiello notes, Voegelin offers an alternative explanation for
            these conflicts:
        </p>

        <p>
            "Tired of waiting for heaven -- that is, for a condition where the
            transcendent would no more have to compromise with the immanent --
            these men and women [of the European wars of religion] tried to
            render it here on earth. Because this cannot be done, they could
            not agree on how to do it; because they could not agree on how to
            do it -- and yet agreed that it needed to be done -- they tore one
            another to shreds."
