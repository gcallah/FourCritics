        <p>
            "Rationalism" is an unfortunately overloaded term. In mainstream
            analytical history of philosophy, it is often used as a contrast
            class to "empiricism."
            "Rationalists" believe that "pure reason" gives us the best guide
            to truth, while "empiricists" favor experience. 
            In this usage, Plato, Descartes, Spinoza,
            and Leibniz are "rationalists," while Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and
            Hume are characterized as "empiricists." While we do not object to
            this use of "rationalism," it has nothing to do with what we wish
            to address in this work.
        </p>

        <p>
            Instead, the notion of "rationalism" we are dealing with is about
            the relationship of the abstract and the
            concrete. The common thread connecting our critics of rationalism
            is that each of them, in one way or another, criticized "abstract
            thought" not in and of itself, but insofar as it tried to replace
            "concrete thought," or tradition, or evolved moral rules,
            as a guide to how people actually should behave,
            or how they actually should evaluate certain proposals.
            (One thing that differentiates these thinkers is what exactly they
            contrast rationalism to.)

        <p>
            So, as a preliminary effort at clarifying what "rationalism" means,
            let us describe how we understand the "rationalism" that each of
            our thinkers criticizes, if not explicitly, then at least
            implicitly.

            <li>
                <span class="author">F. A. Hayek</span>
                <br>
                    Hayek developed his critique of rationalism in the context
                    of defeasing the socialist planner's pretense that he could
                    "rationally" direct the entirety of a society's economic
                    activity according to a plan worked out from purely
                    theoretical knowledge of that society: no knowledge of "the
                    circumstances of time and place" was necessary, according
                    to the socialist planner. Unlike Oakeshott, Hayek tended to
                    see the complement of rationalism as <i>non</i>rational,
                    rather than as a different form of reason from abstract
                    thought.

            <li>
                <span class="author">Alasdair MacIntyre</span>
                <br>
                    MacIntyre's chief rationalist target is Enlightenment, or
                    "encyclopedic," morality, which claims that it can work out
                    moral behavior from abstract principles, without 
                    an "irrational" reliance on moral customs and habits.
                <br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="author">Michael Oakeshott</span>
                <br>
                    For Oakeshott, rationalism is first and foremost the
                    attempt to dispense with practical know-how by substituting
                    for it an abstraction drawn <i>from</i> practice. 
                    Such an attempt has no possibility of success, but it can
                    nevertheless have pernicious consequences for those who try
                    to pursue this "ideal." He sees rationalism as having an
                    especially strong hold on politics, as the practitioners
                    may not directly suffer the consequences of their faulty
                    decision making themselves, but can impose those effects on
                    others.

                <span class="author">Michael Polanyi</span>
                <br>
                    Polanyi did not employ the term "rationalism," instead
                    drawing a distinction between knowledge that can be
                    explicitly stated, and "tacit knowledge," or knowing how to
                    do something, perhaps without being able to state in rules
                    or abstract principles exactly what one knows.

            <li>
                <span class="author">Gilbert Ryle</span>
                <br />
                    Gilbert Ryle's critique of rationalism focuses
                    on the claim made by many modern
                    epistemologists that all knowledge can
                    be reduced to 'knowing that...'
                    statements, while Ryle instead insists
                    that there are multiple forms of
                    knowledge that cannot be reduced to
                    mere statements of fact.  Indeed, questions
                    about 'knowing how' to do something
                    (e.g. hit a baseball, ride a bicycle, speak
                    Spanish, play the mandolin, formulate
                    a scientific hypothesis, etc.) are not
                    reducible to statements of fact, at all.
                    He associates the reductionist
                    argument with a misguided notion about
                    the relevance of the methods of the
                    natural sciences to other forms of knowing.

            <li>
                <span class="author">Eric Voegelin</span>
                <br>
                    Again, Voegelin does not use the term "rationalism" in the
                    way that Oakeshott and Hayek do, and instead attacks
                    "ideology." While there is some difference in meaning here,
                    there is also common ground: to Oakeshott, "rationalism in
                    politics" presents itself as ideologies. And Voegelin
                    understands ideologies to be destructive, for one reason,
                    because they denigrate "common sense" and pragmatism, so
                    that we would sensibly see Oakeshott and Voegelin both as
                    advocates of "practical politics" as opposed to ideological
                    politics.

                <span class="author">Ludwig Wittgenstein</span>
                <br>
                     Wittgenstein's main rationalist target was the attempt to
                     turn thought, and in particular philosophical thought,
                     into pure formalism. He noted that, for instance, our
                     ability to follow a rule cannot have a merely formal
                     foundation, but rests in a way of life that gives meaning
                     to the formal specification.
