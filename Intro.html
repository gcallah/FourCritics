            What Is Rationalism?
        </h3>

        <p>
            "Rationalism" is an unfortunately overloaded term. In mainstream
            analytical history of philosophy, it is often used as a contrast
            class to "empiricism."
            "Rationalists" believe that "pure reason" gives us the best guide
            to truth, while "empiricists" favor experience. 
            In this usage, Plato, Descartes, Spinoza,
            and Leibniz are "rationalists," while Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and
            Hume are characterized as "empiricists." While we do not object to
            this use of "rationalism," it has nothing to do with what we wish
            to address in this work.
        </p>

        <p>
            Instead, the notion of "rationalism" we are dealing with is about
            the relationship of the abstract and the
            concrete. The common thread connecting our critics of rationalism
            is that each of them, in one way or another, criticized "abstract
            thought" not in and of itself, but insofar as it tried to replace
            "concrete thought," or tradition, or evolved moral rules,
            as a guide to how people actually should behave,
            or how they actually should evaluate certain proposals.
            (One thing that differentiates these thinkers is what exactly they
            contrast rationalism to.)
        </p>

        <p>
            So, as a preliminary effort at clarifying what "rationalism" means,
            let us describe how we understand the "rationalism" that each of
            our thinkers criticizes, if not explicitly, then at least
            implicitly.

            The Critics of Rationalism
        </h3>

        <ul>

            <li>
                <span class="author">F. A. Hayek</span>
                <br>
                    Hayek developed his critique of rationalism in the context
                    of defeasing the socialist planner's pretense that he could
                    "rationally" direct the entirety of a society's economic
                    activity according to a plan worked out from purely
                    theoretical knowledge of that society: no knowledge of "the
                    circumstances of time and place" was necessary, according
                    to the socialist planner. Unlike Oakeshott, Hayek tended to
                    see the complement of rationalism as <i>non</i>rational,
                    rather than as a different form of reason from abstract
                    thought.
                <br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="author">Alasdair MacIntyre</span>
                <br>
                    MacIntyre's chief rationalist target is Enlightenment, or
                    "encyclopedic," morality, which claims that it can work out
                    moral behavior from abstract principles, without 
                    an "irrational" reliance on moral customs and habits.
                <br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="author">Michael Oakeshott</span>
                <br>
                    For Oakeshott, rationalism is first and foremost the
                    attempt to dispense with practical know-how by substituting
                    for it an abstraction drawn <i>from</i> practice. 
                    Such an attempt has no possibility of success, but it can
                    nevertheless have pernicious consequences for those who try
                    to pursue this "ideal." He sees rationalism as having an
                    especially strong hold on politics, as the practitioners
                    may not directly suffer the consequences of their faulty
                    decision making themselves, but can impose those effects on
                    others.

            <li>
                <span class="author">Michael Polanyi</span>
                <br>
                    Polanyi did not employ the term "rationalism," instead
                    drawing a distinction between knowledge that can be
                    explicitly stated, and "tacit knowledge," or knowing how to
                    do something, perhaps without being able to state in rules
                    or abstract principles exactly what one knows.
                <br>
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="author">Gilbert Ryle</span>
                <br />
                    Gilbert Ryle's critique of rationalism focuses
                    on the claim made by many modern
                    epistemologists that all knowledge can
                    be reduced to 'knowing that...'
                    statements, while Ryle instead insists
                    that there are multiple forms of
                    knowledge that cannot be reduced to
                    mere statements of fact.  Indeed, questions
                    about 'knowing how' to do something
                    (e.g. hit a baseball, ride a bicycle, speak
                    Spanish, play the mandolin, formulate
                    a scientific hypothesis, etc.) are not
                    reducible to statements of fact, at all.
                    He associates the reductionist
                    argument with a misguided notion about
                    the relevance of the methods of the
                    natural sciences to other forms of knowing.
                <br />
            </li>

            <li>
                <span class="author">Eric Voegelin</span>
                <br>
                    Again, Voegelin does not use the term "rationalism" in the
                    way that Oakeshott and Hayek do, and instead attacks
                    "ideology." While there is some difference in meaning here,
                    there is also common ground: to Oakeshott, "rationalism in
                    politics" presents itself as ideologies.
                    In fact, a good definition of an ideology would be
                    "an attempt to conduct politics according to a theory, 
                    rather than guided by practical reason." And Voegelin
                    understands ideologies to be destructive, for one reason,
                    because they denigrate "common sense" and pragmatism, so
                    that we would sensibly see Oakeshott and Voegelin both as
                    advocates of "practical politics" as opposed to ideological
                    politics.

            <li>
                <span class="author">Ludwig Wittgenstein</span>
                <br>
                     Wittgenstein's main rationalist target was the attempt to
                     turn thought, and in particular philosophical thought,
                     into pure formalism. He noted that, for instance, our
                     ability to follow a rule cannot have a merely formal
                     foundation, but rests in a way of life that gives meaning
                     to the formal specification.

        <h3>
            The Essays
        </h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Zoltan Balazs,
                "Rationalism and Irrationalism:
                Aurel Kolnai and Michael Oakeshott"
                <br />
                <br />
                Zoltan Balazs compares the moral thinking of the Hungarian 
                philosopher and political theorist with that of Michael
                Oakeshott. Despite broad areas of agreement between the two --
                both are, in some sense, conservative, and both are critical
                of the modern rationalist rejection of habit and custom --
                Balazs finds that Kolnai provides something Oakeshott lacks:
                a robust, non-relativistic conception of the good, and a
                positive view of the role that a (non-rationalist) moral
                philosophy might provide in shoring up that conception.
            </li>

            <li>Nathanael Blake,
                <a href="AgainstRationalismAndRelativism.pdf"> 
                "Between Rationalism and Relativism: Gadamer and MacIntyre on
                Truth and Finitude"
                </a>
                <br />
                <br />
                Blake contends that the work of Gadamer and MacIntyre shows us
                how to avoid the complementary dangers of rigid moral certitude
                and spineless moral relativism. Both Gadamer and MacIntyre (who
                has drawn heavily on Gadamer in his own writing) argue that
                accepting the historically contingent nature of all of our
                moral reasoning does <i>not</i> imply that any old moral
                position is just as good as any other one. As Blake has it,
                "Presenting Enlightenment rationalism as the alternative to
                relativism is a false dichotomy... Rationality does not entail
                leaping outside of our historical existence, but develops within
                it."
                <br />
                <br />
                Both authors examined by Blake hold that tradition, far from
                being an obstacle to reason, is, in fact, its necessary
                ground: we can reason at all only by having become educated in a
                tradition that instructs us in how to do so. As Gadamer notes,
                pure inertia is never enough to sustain a tradition; instead,
                it must be "affirmed, embraced, cultivated," and the
                continuation of a tradition is every it as much a choice as 
                is revolution against it.
                <br />
                <br />
                Furthermore, in moral reasoning the concrete is always more
                important than the abstract, or, as Blake writes, "Moral 
                clarity arises from the realization that this is
                the right thing to do, here and now, in this
                particular circumstance."
                <br />
                <br />
                In the end, Blake finds MacIntyre's viewpoint more
                comprehensive than Gadamer's, in that the latter
                is dismissive of natural law theories of morality,
                while the former finds a place for them 
                as the ground rules for any engagement in moral reasoning with
                others.

            <li>Gene Callahan,
                <a href="https://gcallah.github.io/Rationalism/HayekOakeshott.html">
                    "Hayek and Oakeshott on Rationalism"
                </a>
                <br />
                <br />
                Callahan's central thesis is that, while
                Oakeshott's and Hayek's understanding of rationalism
                bear similarities, there are also important differences,
                differences that are, in the end, even more important than
                the similiarities. Furthermore, the differences are
                comprehensible when understood as arising from the two 
                thinkers different philosophical outlooks: Hayek's
                emergent materialism and Oakeshott's idealism.
                Given his outlook, Hayek must understand rationalism
                as the attempt to handle, with reason, areas of human life
                that are inherently "nonrational." Oakeshott, on the
                other hand, conceives as rationalism as the attempt
                to apply <i>abstract</i> reason, and in particular scientific
                abstractions, to problems that can only be handled
                through practical reasoning.

            <li>Timothy Fuller,
                <a href="Hobbes.pdf">
                "Oakeshott, Strauss and Voegelin on Hobbes"
                </a>
                <br />
                <br />
                Strauss saw a fundamental continuity between Hobbes
                and the classical tradition of political philosophy in the
                following regard: "He pursued a philosophic understanding of
                politics which cannot be reduced merely to debate over policy
                preferences."
                <br />
                <br />
                Voegelin appreciated Hobbes's effort to dampen the
                fanaticism that the religious schisms of his time had produced.
                But he argued that Hobbes's attempt ultimately came up short,
                as questions of "ultimate meaning" cannot, in fact,
                be continually banished from politics, but will
                repeatedly arise in new political movements resisting
                the banishment of the sacred from political life.
                <br />
                <br />
                Oakeshott understood Hobbes as the first great thinker
                to seriously grapple with the modern condition of 
                a polity composed of individuals with fundamentally
                divergent worldviews.
                <br />
                <br />
                Fuller concludes, "Oakeshott, Strauss and Voegelin, in setting
                out to do this each in his own way, attest to Hobbes’s
                significance by engaging him at the level of philosophic
                dialogue he invites."
            </li>

            <li>Grant Havers,
                "Wittgenstein and the Athens-Jerusalem Conflict"
                <br />
                <br />
                Grant Havers addresses the problem of the "two Wittgensteins":
                the young positivist who wrote the <i>Tractatus</i>, and the
                latter thinker who was skeptical about the power of abstract
                thought, and at times even seemed skeptical of the whole
                philosophical venture. Havers sets his examination of
                Wittgenstein in the context of the conflict between
                Athens and Jerusalem highlighted by Leo Strauss. 
                <br />
                <br />
                In particular, Havers asked whether, by his later-life embrace
                of the "Jerusalem" side of the conflict with "Athens,"
                Wittgenstein had not, in fact, abandoned philosophy completely
                in favor of faith. Havers seeks his answer chiefly in
                Wittgenstein's work <i>Culture and Value</i>, believing it
                "represents Wittgenstein's deepest reflections on the conflict
                between Athens and Jerusalem." In particular, Havers sees  that
                work as containing Wittgenstein's "subtle defense of the
                ontological argument" for the existence of God. Havers believes
                that this argument, as understood by Wittgenstein, "helps us
                truly understand what is at stake in the conflict between 
                Athens and Jerusalem."
                <br />
                <br />
                Havers provocatively suggests that Wittgenstein, in the
                end, finds the ontological argument to be one that shortcuts
                the dualism of religion <i>versus</i> philosophy, as it
                employs philosophical reasoning to demonstrate that God
                is not an empirical object that science could discover
                "out there" in the world, and that faith in God, once
                properly understood as an <i>attitude towards life</i>,
                is at least as "rational" as scientific materialism.
                And he goes on to suggest that true philosophy and genuine
                religious faith are actually allies, both opposed to "the
                idols of God and Man."

                contemporary, Gilbert Ryle. Ryle's masterwork, <i>The
                Concept of Mind</i>, received a favorable review from 
                Oakeshott, although he did criticize it for offering a 
                somwhat shallow characterization of idealism. Neverthless,
                the reviewer clearly felt that Ryle's critique of
                contemporary doctrines of mind as a "ghost in the machine"
                were largely in agreement with his own work on rational
                conduct. Neither thinker thought that action could 
                possibly come about as it should per the rationalist 
                account: no one could "rationally," with an empty slate
                mind, simply think about some activity, prior to having
                engaged in it, and then go about it with mastery. Oakeshott's
                summary of Ryle (from his review) shows how close their 
                ideas were:
                <br />
                <br />
                "In general [Ryle's] doctrine is that 'when we describe people
                is exercising qualities of mind, we are not referring to occult
                episodes of which their overt acts and utterances are effects:
                we are referring to those overt acts and utterances
                themselves.' Mental activity is not the activity of a 'mind,'
                or activity which takes place in the hidden recesses of a mind,
                in distinction from the activity of a body: it is doing and
                saying things in a particular manner."
                <br />
                <br />
                Neverthless, the two thinkers differed in some important ways.
                As McIntyre notes, Oakeshott had a much more robust conception
                of the "modes" in which thought might appear than did Ryle, who
                simply noted that we quite properly think about different areas
                of life employing different ways of proceeding. And the
                philosophical basis for Oakeshott's critique of rationalism is
                more explicit: it stems from his British Idealist roots. Ryle,
                a serious student of phenomenological philosophy, mentioned
                that his attack on the ghost in the machine might be understood
                as a work of phenomenology, but did not stress this connection,
                something that might be viewed as either a weakness or a
                strength in his approach, depending on one's view of the
                importance of philosophical grounding for an epistemology.
                <br />
                <br />
                Despite these differences, Oakeshott and Ryle can be seen as 
                twin sons of different mothers, both working to undermine the
                same, prevalent misconception of the nature of the mental. As
                McIntyre sums it up:
                <br />
                <br />
                "The philosophical significance of Ryle's
                and Oakeshott's conclusions is
                quite far-reaching. The acceptance of the priority of tacit knowledge
                involves the rejection of philosophical
                accounts of morality, politics, and
                the law which reduce them to a set of
                rule-like statements and a similar
                rejection of the reductionist accounts of
                epistemology."

                Michael Polanyi, Eric Voegelin, and the Indispensability of
                Faith"
                <br />
                <br />
                Mitchell compares the attitude of Eric Voegelin and
                Michael Polanyi to the problem of faith.
                <br />
                <br />
                As Mitchell puts it:
                "the epistemological solution encompassed in Polanyi's
                personal knowledge fits well with Voegelin’s insistence that we
                must recover an awareness of human participation in
                transcendent reality...
                the solutions offered by both provide useful
                supports for the other: Polanyi's theory of knowledge adds an
                important dimension to Voegelin, while Voegelin's insistence on
                openness to the transcendent makes explicit what Polanyi only
                occasionally intimates."
