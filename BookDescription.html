            Gene Callahan is a charter member of the Michael Oakeshott
            Association. He did his PhD thesis on Oakeshott under the
            supervision of David Boucher at Cardiff University. His book
            <i>Oakeshott on Rome and America</i> received broad praise in a
            number of reviews. He has also published papers on the work of F.A.
            Hayek and Eric Voegelin, and is an associate editor at the web site
            <i>Voegelin View</i>.

            In the first half of the twentieth century,
            the rationalist tide had reached its high mark.
            The arts, so it was held,
            were to be revolutionized according to rationalist precepts.
            In architecture and city planning,
            rationalism would sweep away that unnecessary clutter of old prejudices
            that restrained traditional architecture and 
			customary urban organization and build the modern,
            functional buildings and communities that people truly needed.
            Child-rearing also was to be brought into 
            accord with ‘scientific’ principles.
            Traditional agricultural practices were to be rejected and replaced
            by "scientific" agriculture, and a similar change was to sweep away
            long-standing principles of forest management.
            And, with the Soviet Union seen as setting 
            the example of a shining city on a hill,
            society as a whole was to be transformed into a utopia by
            tossing aside all attachment to atavistic customs and ancient moral relics
            and proceeding to design social affairs from first principles.

            But World War II, the Holocaust, the Gulag,
            the failure of urban renewal projects,
            the widespread diseases plaguing "scientific" forests and
            agricultural projects,
            and other dismal outcomes of the rationalist program
			have considerably dimmed its popularity.
            However, the evidence of those practical failures would not have 
            been as convincing as it was—perhaps it was the case that
            we just had not found the proper rationalist program yet?--
            if not for the existence of a theoretical diagnosis of the malady.
            That diagnosis was provided by a number of 
            thinkers in the twentieth century.
            The aim of this collection is to compare and contrast the ideas of
            some of these leading critics of rationalism:
            Eric Voegelin, Michael Polanyi, F.A. Hayek, Ludwig Wittgenstein,
            Gilbert Ryle, Michael Oakeshott, Alasdair MacIntyre and others.
            While each can be seen as a critic of rationalism,
            were they each attacking the same thing? 
            In what senses did their analyses overlap,
            and in what senses did they differ?
            Clarifying these issues will provide important insights into
            this major intellectual trend of the past century.
