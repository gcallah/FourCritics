            Gene Callahan is a charter member of the Michael Oakeshott
            Association. He did his PhD thesis on Oakeshott under the
            supervision of David Boucher at Cardiff University. His book
            <i>Oakeshott on Rome and America</i> received broad praise in a
            number of reviews. He has also published papers on the work of F.A.
            Hayek and Eric Voegelin, and is an associate editor at the web site
            <i>Voegelin View</i>.

            In the first half of the twentieth century,
            the rationalist tide had reached its high mark.
            The arts, so it was held,
            were to be revolutionized according to rationalist precepts.
            In architecture and city planning,
            rationalism would sweep away that unnecessary clutter of old prejudices
            that restrained traditional architecture and 
			customary urban organization and build the modern,
            functional buildings and communities that people truly needed.
            Child-rearing also was to be brought into 
            accord with ‘scientific’ principles.
            Traditional agricultural practices were to be rejected and replaced
            by "scientific" agriculture, and a similar change was to sweep away
            long-standing principles of forest management.
            And, with the Soviet Union seen as setting 
            the example of a shining city on a hill,
            society as a whole was to be transformed into a utopia by
            tossing aside all attachment to atavistic customs and ancient moral relics
            and proceeding to design social affairs from first principles.

        <p>
            But World War II, the Holocaust, the Gulag,
            the failure of urban renewal projects,
            the widespread diseases plaguing "scientific" forests and
            agricultural projects,
            and other dismal outcomes of the rationalist program
			have considerably dimmed its popularity.
            However, the evidence of those practical failures would not have 
            been as convincing as it was—perhaps it was the case that
            we just had not found the proper rationalist program yet?--
            if not for the existence of a theoretical diagnosis of the malady.
            That diagnosis was provided by a number of 
            thinkers in the twentieth century.
            The aim of this collection is to compare and contrast the ideas of
            some of these leading critics of rationalism:
            Eric Voegelin, Michael Polanyi, F.A. Hayek, Ludwig Wittgenstein,
            Gilbert Ryle, Michael Oakeshott, Alasdair MacIntyre and others.
            While each can be seen as a critic of rationalism,
            were they each attacking the same thing? 
            In what senses did their analyses overlap,
            and in what senses did they differ?
            Clarifying these issues will provide important insights into
            this major intellectual trend of the past century.

            "Rationalism" is an unfortunately overloaded term. In mainstream
            analytical history of philosophy, it is often used as a contrast
            class to "empiricism."
            "Rationalists" believe that "pure reason" gives us the best guide
            to truth, while "empiricists" favor experience. 
            In this usage, Plato, Descartes, Spinoza,
            and Leibniz are "rationalists," while Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and
            Hume are characterized as "empiricists." While we do not object to
            this use of "rationalism," it has nothing to do with what we wish
            to address in this work.
        </p>

        <p>
            Instead, the notion of "rationalism" we are dealing with is about
            the relationship of the abstract and the
            concrete. The common thread connecting our critics of rationalism
            is that each of them, in one way or another, criticized "abstract
            thought" not in and of itself, but insofar as it tried to replace
            "concrete thought," or tradition, or evolved moral rules,
            as a guide to how people actually should behave,
            or how they actually should evaluate certain proposals.
            (One thing that differentiates these thinkers is what exactly they
            contrast rationalism to.)
        </p>

        <p>
            So, as a preliminary effort at clarifying what "rationalism" means,
            let us describe how we understand the "rationalism" that several of
            our thinkers criticize, if not explicitly, then at least
            implicitly.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Michael Oakeshott
                <p>
                    For Oakeshott, rationalism is first and foremost the
                    attempt to dispense with practical know-how by substituting
                    for it an abstraction drawn <i>from</i> practice. 
                    Such an attempt has no possibility of success, but it can
                    nevertheless have pernicious consequences for those who try
                    to pursue this "ideal." He sees rationalism as having an
                    especially strong hold on politics, as the practitioners
                    may not directly suffer the consequences of their faulty
                    decision making themselves, but can impose those effects on
                    others.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                F. A. Hayek
                <p>
                    Hayek developed his critique of rationalism in the context
                    of defeasing the socialist planner's pretense that he could
                    "rationally" direct the entirety of a society's economic
                    activity according to a plan worked out from purely
                    theoretical knowledge of that society: no knowledge of "the
                    circumstances of time and place" was necessary, according
                    to the socialist planner. Unlike Oakeshott, Hayek tended to
                    see the complement of rationalism as <i>non</i>rational,
                    rather than as a different form of reason from abstract
                    thought.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                Michael Polanyi
                <p>
                    Polanyi did not employ the term "rationalism," instead
                    drawing a distinction between knowledge that can be
                    explicitly stated, and "tacit knowledge," or knowing how to
                    do something, perhaps without being able to state in rules
                    or abstract principles exactly what one knows.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                Eric Voegelin
                <p>
                    Again, Voegelin does not use the term "rationalism" in the
                    way that Oakeshott and Hayek do, and instead attacks
                    "ideology." While there is some difference in meaning here,
                    there is also common ground: to Oakeshott, "rationalism in
                    politics" presents itself as ideologies. And Voegelin
                    understands ideologies to be destructive, for one reason,
                    because they denigrate "common sense" and pragmatism, so
                    that we would sensibly see Oakeshott and Voegelin both as
                    advocates of "practical politics" as opposed to ideological
                    politics. Furthermore, Voegelin was a critic of
                    "scientism," which is the main strain of rationalism.

            </li>
            <li>
                Ludwig Wittgenstein
                <p>
                     Wittgenstein's main rationalist target was the attempt to
                     turn thought, and in particular philosophical thought,
                     into pure formalism. He noted that, for instance, our
                     ability to follow a rule cannot have a merely formal
                     foundation, but rests in a way of life that gives meaning
                     to the formal specification.
                </p>

            </li>
            <li>
                Alasdair MacIntyre
                <p>
                    MacIntyre's chief rationalist target is Enlightenment, or
                    "encyclopedic," morality, which claims that it can work out
                    moral behavior from abstract principles, without 
                    an "irrational" reliance on moral customs and habits.
                    He constrasts that with moral thought that explicitly
                    recognizes that it has roots in a tradition of moral
                    reasoning.
