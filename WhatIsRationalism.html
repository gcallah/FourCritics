            What Is Rationalism?
        </h1>

        <p>
            "Rationalism" is an unfortunately overloaded term. In mainstream
            analytical history of philosophy, it is often used as a contrast
            class to "empiricism."
            "Rationalists" believe that "pure reason" gives us the best guide
            to truth, while "empiricists" favor experience. 
            In this usage, Plato, Descartes, Spinoza,
            and Leibniz are "rationalists," while Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and
            Hume are characterized as "empiricists." While we do not object to
            this use of "rationalism," it has nothing to do with what we wish
            to address in this work.
        </p>

        <p>
            Instead, the notion of "rationalism" we are dealing with has to do,
            in a general sense, with the relationship of the abstract and the
            concrete. The common thread connecting our critics of rationalism
            is that each of them, in one way or another, criticized "abstract
            thought" not in and of itself, but insofar as it tried to replace
            "concrete thought" as a guide to how people actually should behave,
            or how they actually should evaluate certain proposals.
            And, to some extent, many of our critics of 'rationalism'
        </p>

        <p>
            So, as a preliminary effort at clarifying what "rationalism" means,
            let us describe how we understand the "rationalism" that each of
            our thinkers criticizes, if not explicitly, then at least
            implicitly.

                Michael Oakeshott
                <p>
                    For Oakeshott, rationalism is first and foremost the
                    attempt to dispense with concrete reality by substituting
                    for it an abstraction drawn <i>from</i> concrete reality. 
                    Such an attempt has no possibility of success, but it can
                    nvertheless have pernicious consequences for those who try
                    to pursue this "ideal."

                F. A. Hayek
                <p>
                    Hayek developed his critique of rationalism in the context
                    of defeasing the socialist planner's pretense that he could
                    "rationally" direct the entirety of a society's economic
                    activity according to a plan worked out from purely
                    theoretical knowledge of that society: no knowledge of "the
                    circumstances of time and place" was necessary, according
                    to the socialist planner.
