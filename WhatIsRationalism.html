            What Is Rationalism?
        </h1>

        <p>
            "Rationalism" is an unfortunately overloaded term. In mainstream
            analytical history of philosophy, it is often used as a contrast
            class to "empiricism."
            "Rationalists" believe that "pure reason" gives us the best guide
            to truth, while "empiricists" favor experience. 
            In this usage, Plato, Descartes, Spinoza,
            and Leibniz are "rationalists," while Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and
            Hume are characterized as "empiricists." While we do not object to
            this use of "rationalism," it has nothing to do with what we wish
            to address in this work.
