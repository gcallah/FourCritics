            <li>Corey Abel,
                "Rationalism as a Political Style".
                <br />
                In Corey Abel's essay, he examines...
            </li>

            <li>Zoltan Balazs,
                "Rationalism and Irrationalism:
                Aurel Kolnai and Michael Oakeshott"
                <br />
                Zoltan Balazs compares the moral thinking of the Hungarian 
                philosopher and political theorist with that of Michael
                Oakeshott. Despite broad areas of agreement between the two --
                both are, in some sense, conservative, and both are critical
                of the modern rationalist rejection of habit and custom --
                Balazs finds that Kolnai provides something Oakeshott lacks:
                a robust, non-relativistic conception of the good, and a
                positive view of the role that a (non-rationalist) moral
                philosophy might provide in shoring up that conception.
            </li>

            <li>Nathanael Blake,
                <a href="AgainstRationalismAndRelativism.pdf"> 
                "Between Rationalism and Relativism: Gadamer and MacIntyre on
                Truth and Finitude"
                </a>
                <br />
                Blake contends that the work of Gadamer and MacIntyre shows us
                how to avoid the complementary dangers of rigid moral certitude
                and spineless moral relativism. Both Gadamer and MacIntyre (who
                has drawn heavily on Gadamer in his own writing) argue that
                accepting the historically contingent nature of all of our
                moral reasoning does <i>not</i> imply that any old moral
                position is just as good as any other one. As Blake has it,
                "Presenting Enlightenment rationalism as the alternative to
                relativism is a false dichotomy... Rationality does not entail
                leaping outside of our historical existence, but develops within
                it."
                <br />
                Both authors examined by Blake hold that tradition, far from
                being an obstacle to reason, is, in fact, its necessary
                ground: we can reason at all only by having become educated in a
                tradition that instructs us in how to do so. As Gadamer notes,
                pure inertia is never enough to sustain a tradition; instead,
                it must be "affirmed, embraced, cultivated," and the
                continuation of a tradition is every it as much a choice as 
                is revolution against it.
                <br />
                Furthermore, in moral reasoning the concrete is always more
                important than the abstract, or, as Blake writes, "Moral 
                clarity arises from the realization that this is
                the right thing to do, here and now, in this
                particular circumstance."
                <br />
                In the end, Blake finds MacIntyre's viewpoint more
                comprehensive than Gadamer's, in that the latter
                is dismissive of natural law theories of morality,
                while the former finds a place for them 
                as the ground rules for any engagement in moral reasoning with
                others.

            <li>Gene Callahan,
                <a href="https://gcallah.github.io/Rationalism/HayekOakeshott.html">
                    "Hayek and Oakeshott on Rationalism"
                </a>
                <br />
                Callahan's central thesis is that, while
                Oakeshott's and Hayek's understanding of rationalism
                bear similarities, there are also important differences,
                differences that are, in the end, even more important than
                the similiarities. Furthermore, the differences are
                comprehensible when understood as arising from the two 
                thinkers different philosophical outlooks: Hayek's
                emergent materialism and Oakeshott's idealism.
                Given his outlook, Hayek must understand rationalism
                as the attempt to handle, with reason, areas of human life
                that are inherently "nonrational." Oakeshott, on the
                other hand, conceives as rationalism as the attempt
                to apply <i>abstract</i> reason, and in particular scientific
                abstractions, to problems that can only be handled
                through practical reasoning.

            <li>Timothy Fuller,
                <a href="Hobbes.pdf">
                "Oakeshott, Strauss and Voegelin on Hobbes"
                </a>
                <br />
                Strauss saw a fundamental continuity between Hobbes
                and the classical tradition of political philosophy in the
                following regard: "He pursued a philosophic understanding of
                politics which cannot be reduced merely to debate over policy
                preferences."
                <br />
                Voegelin appreciated Hobbes's effort to dampen the
                fanaticism that the religious schisms of his time had produced.
                But he argued that Hobbes's attempt ultimately came up short,
                as questions of "ultimate meaning" cannot, in fact,
                be continually banished from politics, but will
                repeatedly arise in new political movements resisting
                the banishment of the sacred from political life.
                <br />
                Oakeshott understood Hobbes as the first great thinker
                to seriously grapple with the modern condition of 
                a polity composed of individuals with fundamentally
                divergent worldviews.
                <br />
                Fuller concludes, "Oakeshott, Strauss and Voegelin, in setting
                out to do this each in his own way, attest to Hobbesâ€™s
                significance by engaging him at the level of philosophic
                dialogue he invites."

                <a href="OakeshottRyleRationalism.pdf">
                "The Critique of Scientism: Ryle and Oakeshott on Tacit
                Knowledge"
                </a>
                <br />
                Kenneth McIntyre's paper examines the similar critiques
                of rationalism offered by Oakeshott and his English
                contemporary, Gilbert Ryle. Ryle's masterwork, <i>The
                Concept of Mind</i>, received a favorable review from 
                Oakeshott, although he did criticize it for offering a 
                somwhat shallow characterization of idealism. Neverthless,
                the reviewer clearly felt that Ryle's critique of
                contemporary doctrines of mind as a "ghost in the machine"
                were largely in agreement with his own work on rational
                conduct. Neither thinker thought that action could 
                possibly come about as it should per the rationalist 
                account: no one could "rationally," with an empty slate
                mind, simply think about some activity, prior to having
                engaged in it, and then go about it with mastery. Oakeshott's
                summary of Ryle (from his review) shows how close their 
                ideas were:
                <br />
                "In general [Ryle's] doctrine is that 'when we describe people
                is exercising qualities of mind, we are not referring to occult
                episodes of which their overt acts and utterances are effects:
                we are referring to those overt acts and utterances
                themselves.' Mental activity is not the activity of a 'mind,'
                or activity which takes place in the hidden recesses of a mind,
                in distinction from the activity of a body: it is doing and
                saying things in a particular manner."
                <br />
                Neverthless, the two thinkers differed in some important ways.
                As McIntyre notes, Oakeshott had a much more robust conception
                of the "modes" in which thought might appear than did Ryle, who
                simply noted that we quite properly think about different areas
                of life employing different ways of proceeding. And the
                philosophical basis for Oakeshott's critique of rationalism is
                more explicit: it stems from his British Idealist roots. Ryle,
                a serious student of phenomenological philosophy, mentioned
                that his attack on the ghost in the machine might be understood
                as a work of phenomenology, but did not stress this connection,
                something that might be viewed as either a weakness or a
                strength in his approach, depending on one's view of the
                importance of philosophical grounding for... [WHAT?]
                <br />
                Despite these differences, Oakeshott and Ryle can be seen as 
                twin sons of different mothers, both working to undermine the
                same, prevalent misconception of the nature of the mental. As
                McIntyre sums it up:
                <br />
                "The philosophical significance of Ryle's and Oakeshott's conclusions is
                quite far-reaching. The acceptance of the priority of tacit knowledge
                involves the rejection of philosophical
                accounts of morality, politics, and
                the law which reduce them to a set of rule-like statements and a similar
                rejection of the reductionist accounts of
                epistemology."
