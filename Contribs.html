            <li>Gene Callahan,
                <a href="https://gcallah.github.io/Rationalism/HayekOakeshott.html">
                    "Hayek and Oakeshott on Rationalism"
                </a>
                <br />
                Callahan's central thesis is that, while
                Oakeshott's and Hayek's understanding of rationalism
                bear similarities, there are also important differences,
                differences that are, in the end, even more important than
                the similiarities. Furthermore, the differences are
                comprehensible when understood as arising from the two 
                thinkers different philosophical outlooks: Hayek's
                emergent materialism and Oakeshott's idealism.
                Given his outlook, Hayek must understand rationalism
                as the attempt to handle, with reason, areas of human life
                that are inherently "nonrational." Oakeshott, on the
                other hand, conceives as rationalism as the attempt
                to apply <i>abstract</i> reason, and in particular scientific
                abstractions, to problems that can only be handled
                through practical reasoning.

                </a>
            </li>

            <li>Timothy Fuller,
                <a href="Hobbes.pdf">
                "Oakeshott, Strauss and Voegelin on Hobbes"
                </a>
                <br />
                <br />
                Voegelin appreciated Hobbes's effort to dampen the
                fanaticism that the religious schisms of his time had produced.
                But he argued that Hobbes's attempt ultimately came up short,
                as questions of "ultimate meaning" cannot, in fact,
                be continually banished from politics, but will
                repeatedly arise in new political movements resisting
                the banishment of the sacred from political life.
                <br />
                Oakeshott understood Hobbes as the first great thinker
                to seriously grapple with the modern condition of 
                a polity composed of individuals with fundamentally
                divergent worldviews.
                <br />
                Fuller concludes, "Oakeshott, Strauss and Voegelin, in setting
                out to do this each in his own way, attest to Hobbes’s
                significance by engaging him at the level of philosophic
                dialogue he invites."
